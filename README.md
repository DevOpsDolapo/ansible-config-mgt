# ansible-config-mgt
A repository for the Ansible-Automate Project at Darey.io. This project is all about automating processes and writing declarative languages such as `YAML`. The aim of the project is to get DevOps Engineers more accustomed to DevOps tools and practices.

With respect to the Refactoring project, its aim is to teach how to refactor Ansible code, create assignments, and use the imports functionality.

Our architecture will be running on the same infrastructure components as Project 11, but we'll be configuring two (2) more RHEL 8 servers as our UAT Webservers.
